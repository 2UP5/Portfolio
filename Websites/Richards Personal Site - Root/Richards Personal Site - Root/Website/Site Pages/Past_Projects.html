			<p> Stardust is currently my most developed project to date, incorporating various libraries such as BinaryReader and BinaryWriter as well as some early prototyping which utilised DateTime. I did some extra testing and decided to play around with Unity OSC, which allowed me to experiment with ports and use my phone in conjunction with the game to produce a new gameplay effect.</p>
			<p> The project, in summary, is a tycoon game centered around purchasing and launching rockets in order to obtain research, complete Government contracts and eventually intergalactically populate. By design, the project is only meant to be a demonstrative version of what the game could look and feel like if it were to be continued on in the future to a standard of completion.</p>
