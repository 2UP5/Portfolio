			<h3 class="embeddedSection_Header_Format"> Early Computing Introduction: <hr>	</h3>
			<p> From a young age (about 4-5 years old), I was introduced to computers. Much like alot of kids, this involved playing pre-installed games like "Purble Place" on Windows Vista and eventually evolved into exploring the internet and finding web games powered by the now deceased Adobe Flash Player. </p>
			<p> Once I reached around 9 years old, I began investing interest in game development in small amounts which then escalated once I hit 13 where I used ROBLOX Studio to create basic architecture and models. </p>
			
			<h3 class="embeddedSection_Header_Format"> Mid Teens Computing: <hr>	</h3>
			<p> I'm mostly a self taught developer and it has been that way from 13-15 years old until College, at which point, I allowed myself to essentially scrub away everything I knew about coding (which I initially learned around 14-15) and relearn with an open mind. I then spent 3 years in College with the option to skip to a Level 3 course due to my performance. </p>
			<p> Instead, I pushed myself through the 3 years in order to maximise the opportunity to get myself up to a standard I was satisfied with which entailed additional self-teaching combined with the course to propel my knowledge and as a result, the quality of my work. </p>
			
			<h3 class="embeddedSection_Header_Format"> Self Development (Final Year):	<hr> </h3>
			<p> My final year of College was a year I felt like I utilised in the best possible way while working on my final project. I continued on my journey learning C# and used the HDRP package for Unity which allows for various useful, impactful and quality features that cannot be obtained on other pipelines that Unity offers. </p>
			<p> I took the initiative to review the Microsoft documentation on C# libraries such as BinaryWriter (which was a critical addition to my final project) to avoid deprecated libraries (which I often ran into using YouTube videos to help me), and develop a game I could be proud of that best encapsulated my accumulated knowledge and experience. For details on this project, refer to my <a href="../Site Pages/Past_Projects.html">"Past Projects"</a> page. </p>
