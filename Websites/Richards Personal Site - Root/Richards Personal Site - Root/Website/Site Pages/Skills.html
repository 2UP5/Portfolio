			<h3 class="embeddedSection_Header_Format"> 3D Modelling: <hr>	</h3>
			<p style="margin-left:10px">  From 16 to 18, I learned how to create 3D assets for games and other media. I briefly used Cinema4D and Blender before 16 but didn't understand much of anything. 
			<p> From 16 onwards I learned to navigate around Blender with its newer UI (much easier to understand) and proceeded to use it to create 3D assets, render them and eventually I pushed further to much more accurately recreate real life props such as weapons as well as incorporate PBR materials to emphasise the realistic and accurate feel. </p> 

			
			<h3 class="embeddedSection_Header_Format"> Video Editing:	<hr> </h3>
			<p> Initially, my video editing skills started with Windows Movie Maker which gave me the basics of cutting up clips, being able to move them around etc. </p>
			<p> In College, I gained some experience in Adobe Premiere Pro which followed the same path as Windows Movie Maker with a few layered aspects such as isolating and selectively editing different aspects of a video and using keyframes to choose at which points the volume of an audio changes. </p>
			<p> I ventured off onto DaVinci Resolve simply because the more featureless version was a free alternative but still had enough for me to be able to do what I wanted. I played with green screened effects, masking different elements in a video as well as the rudimentary aspects previously mentioned. </p>
